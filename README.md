# clusteringPowerBI
Here, we will use the health expenditure dataset from the World Health Organizationâ€™s Global Health Expenditure database. The dataset contains health expenditure as a % of National GDP for over 200 countries from year 2000 through 2017.  Our objective is to find patterns and groups in this data by using a K-Means clustering algorithm in Power BI.
